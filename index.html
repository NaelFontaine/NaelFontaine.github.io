                    <p>I am highly motivated by the opportunity to pursue a double degree at Polytechnique Montréal. This university is renowned for its academic excellence and ranks among the best engineering institutions in the world. Montréal is also one of the best student cities, offering a multicultural and dynamic environment. Obtaining a double degree from such a prestigious institution would allow me to gain international recognition and expand my professional prospects.</p>

                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The <a href="https://www.education.gouv.fr/les-cordees-de-la-reussite-5035" target="_blank">"Cordées de la réussite"</a> aim to make orientation support a real lever for equal opportunities. Their objective is to fight against self-censorship and to inspire students' academic ambition through continuous support from middle school (8th grade) to high school and into higher education. The mobilization of all actors—middle schools, high schools, higher education institutions, academies, and all partners (ministries, associations, companies, etc.)—continues. The number of student beneficiaries has doubled since 2019. In the 2022-2023 academic year, 915 Cordées were deployed for 180,000 student beneficiaries, with the support of 22,000 student tutors.</p>
                    <p><strong>My Role:</strong> As a mentor for 9th-grade students, I provide individualized support with one student mentor for every two youths. Workshops focus on orientation, public speaking, and self-confidence. Each semester, I work with a different group of middle school students, with the option to commit for only one semester.</p>

                    <p>This year, I completed training to become an SAE Initiator (Artificial Climbing Structure Initiator). The SAE Initiator has the skills to teach climbing and organize its practice on artificial climbing structures.

This summer, I participated in the GMTK 2024 Game Jam, where I collaborated with a team to develop a video game in just four days using Unreal Engine 4. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to apply my programming skills creatively under tight deadlines.</p>
                    <p>The game we created is called "CutOut," and it's available to play online. This project not only enhanced my technical abilities but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and project management.</p>
